Procedure duration (angioplasty)</h5><ul><li><strong>Time frame:</strong> If angioplasty is performed due to a blocked artery, the procedure itself typically takes 1 to 3 hours. This includes inserting the catheter through an artery (usually in the groin or arm), guiding it to the heart, performing vessel dilation with a balloon, and possibly placing a stent.</li></ul><h5>3. Post-procedure care and hospital stay</h5><ul><li><strong>Initial monitoring (recovery):</strong> Immediately after the procedure, the patient stays in the recovery unit or under direct supervision for a few hours to monitor vital signs and the catheter entry site (using a pressure band or specialized devices).</li><li><strong>Total hospital stay:</strong> Studies indicate that long hospitalization is usually not required.

          "description": "<p>Cardiac ablation (also known as heart tissue burning) is an advanced therapeutic procedure used to treat heart rhythm disorders (arrhythmias). In these types of arrhythmias, certain areas of the heart tissue spontaneously generate abnormal contraction rhythms.</p><p>During cardiac ablation, a specialist creates very small lesions in the heart tissue using heat or cold energy, targeting specific areas responsible for causing the arrhythmia.</p><p>The main goal is to eliminate or block abnormal electrical signals in the heart that cause irregular heartbeat. These small lesions help block abnormal electrical pathways and prevent the heart from producing irregular or abnormal rhythms.</p><p>This minimally invasive procedure can be used for a wide range of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and various tachycardias, and often serves as a suitable alternative to long-term anti-arrhythmic medications.</p><h4>Hospitalization duration after cardiac ablation</h4><p>The hospital stay after cardiac ablation is usually short, but it may vary depending on the patient's condition and type of ablation:</p><ol><li><strong>Initial hospitalization:</strong> Most patients stay one night in the hospital after cardiac ablation.</li><li><strong>Purpose of one-night stay:</strong> This period is used for careful heart monitoring (ECG), checking for possible complications (such as bleeding at the catheter site or new irregular heartbeat), and ensuring patient stability after the procedure.</li><li><strong>Discharge:</strong> If the patient is stable and no significant complications are observed, discharge usually occurs the next day (after 24 hours).</li></ol><h4>Hospital wards involved</h4><ol><li><strong>Recovery or CCU (Cardiac Care Unit):</strong> Immediately after the procedure, the patient is transferred to this ward for several hours (or sometimes a few days if minor complications occur) under close medical and nursing supervision.</li><li><strong>Cardiac surgery or Cardiac Ward:</strong> After stabilization in recovery, the patient is moved to the general cardiac ward to spend the night and prepare for discharge.</li></ol><h4>Daily patient visits after cardiac ablation</h4><ol><li><strong>Main visit by the cardiologist (Interventionist or Arrhythmia specialist):</strong> The doctor who performed the ablation usually visits once a day (or according to their schedule) to check overall condition, catheter entry site (groin or neck), initial ECG results, and make discharge decisions.</li><li><strong>Specialist follow-up visits (if necessary):</strong> If the patient has other conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney issues, other specialists (such as endocrinologists or nephrologists) may also visit during the short hospital stay to ensure these conditions are managed.</li></ol>",

Systolic heart failure is a common disease worldwide and a major type of heart failure.</p><p>With the use of various cardiac medications, patients’ life expectancy and quality of life have improved; additionally, one of the most important tools in treating these patients is the CRT pacemaker, which can significantly and directly improve their quality of life.</p><p>In patients with systolic heart failure (e.g., after MI, high blood pressure, etc.), the heart does not contract uniformly, and parts of the ventricular myocardium start contracting with a delay. This condition is called Dyssynchrony, which appears as a wide QRS complex on ECG (QRS > 120 ms indicates dyssynchrony).</p><p>When the myocardium does not contract uniformly, the filling time decreases. Consequently, the blood ejected to the vascular bed and the ejection fraction (EF) also decrease. The CRT pacemaker, through its electrical activity, reduces this dyssynchrony, increases ventricular blood ejection, and can largely restore the heart's function to normal.</p><p>The procedure duration and hospitalization for pacemaker implantation depend on the type of pacemaker (single, dual, or triple chamber) and the patient’s condition.</p><p>Here is an overview based on standard procedures:</p><ol><li><strong>Surgery Duration:</strong> Pacemaker implantation is usually a relatively quick procedure, typically lasting 1–3 hours. The duration varies depending on the difficulty of placing electrodes (pacemaker leads) in the heart chambers.</li><li><strong>Hospitalization and Stay Duration:</strong> Hospitalization for pacemaker implantation is usually slightly longer than for cardiac ablation. <ul><li>Recovery/CCU: Immediately after the procedure, the patient is monitored closely for several hours to check for bleeding at the small incision site (usually under the clavicle or upper chest) and to ensure the device functions properly.</li><li>Cardiac Ward: After stabilization, the patient is transferred to a general cardiac ward.</li><li>Number of nights: Patients are usually hospitalized 1–2 nights after pacemaker implantation.</li><li>One night: For simple cases without complications, the patient may be discharged the next day.</li><li>Two nights: This additional time ensures the device works well for a longer period and that ECG changes remain stable after several hours of rest.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Doctor Visits:</strong> Daily visits are provided.
